# Assets Directory

Place your target images here.

## How to use:
1. Take a screenshot of the button/icon you want to click in your game.
2. Crop it tightly around the button.
3. Save it as a `.png` file in this folder (e.g., `start_button.png`).
4. Update the `Config` in `main.go` or add a UI selector to choose this file.
